Telecom Churn Predictor is a machine learning web app built using Streamlit that predicts whether a telecom customer will churn based on their service usage, contract type, and billing details. This project demonstrates the end-to-end data science workflow â€” from data preprocessing, model training, to deploying a user-friendly interface.
